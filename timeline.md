# Workshop Organization Timeline

This document hopefully provides a somewhat reusable template for the standard
actions of a workshop colocated with some of the major programming language
conferences including SPLASH, ECOOP, and <Programming>.

The workshop is assumed to have a technical paper submission deadline with
reviews as well as a work-in-progress submission deadline for preliminary work,
which will undergo less rigorous reviewing.

Depending on the workshop, one might want to organize a keynote either before
or after paper submission. Generally, better to start early, itâ€™s not as easy
as it sounds to find someone qualified, interesting, good at speak, who is
available, and has their own funding.

Consider sponsors for supporting keynote speaker(s). Speakers do ask for it!

### Between Week T-40 to T-24
 - answer call for workshop proposal in time

 - different conference have different deadlines,
   sometimes long ahead of conference

 - SPLASH has often two deadlines,
   need to make first one if you want ACM DL proceedings

### Somewhere around T-30

 - for SIGPLAN sponsored ACM DL proceedings: get approval for PC

   - list of proposed members (don't have to have agreed yet)

   - name, affiliation, whether on last year's PC, seniority, possibly topics

   - needs to ensure diversity along various dimensions

     - gender

     - seniority

     - countries, institutions

     - and all the things you'd like to get a wide reach for your workshop

### Week T-22

 - have Call for Papers ready (often already part of proposal from early)

 - get CFP reviewed (steering committee, co-organizers, ...)

### Week T-20

 - workshop website online, usually easy, using conference website,
   which is using conf.researchr.org

 - make sure submission system is setup and ready
   (I like HotCRP much better than EasyChair)

 - send out first call for papers

   - high-profile mailing lists, ecoop info, seworld, important community lists

   - collaborators, colleagues, people you know and/or would like to contribute
   
     - be specific, be targetted

 - make sure you have made a decision on a keynote/invited talk (yes, no)

   - if yes, start inviting your ideal candidate
   
   - sometimes, especially for young workshop, try to have the keynote confirmed
     for second way of CFPs

### Week T-18

 - send out second wave of CFPs, language communities,
   mailing lists that you haven't targeted yet

### Week T-15

 - potential second CFP to high-profile lists

### Week T-13

 - Abstract submission deadline

 - Ask PC to bid for papers

 - Ask community, PC members, colleagues etc to submit in if necessary
 
### Week T-12

 - Technical paper submission deadline

 - Might need to extend deadline

 - Otherwise

   - Ask PC for paper bids

   - Assign reviews

### Week T-11

 - potentially extended deadline

### Week T-9

 - kind reminder to your very busy PC

   - they volunteered, and have few time, be nice to them, value their work!

   - but, they usually appreciate a kind reminder!

   - be targeted, don't spam people who already did all their reviews!

### Week T-8

 - Deadline for reviews (reviewers should have at least 4 weeks)

 - After deadline get out the whip. but be kind!

   - it's like herding cats, if not worse

   - bribe them with cat pictures, some say it works
     (not my personal style though)

 - plan for some room for discussions
 
 - you got a keynote/invited talk yet? if you want one, get it organized now!!
 
   - SPLASH ideally wanted to know workshop keynotes by around T-7

### Week T-7

 - Author notification for technical papers

   - Should be 1 or 2 weeks before early registration deadline of conference

 - Work-in-progress (WIP) paper deadline

 - Call for participation with program (advertise the program/workshop!)

   - possibly including a reminder for WIP deadline

   - Send to mailing lists, colleagues, collaborators,
     potential collaborators, etc.
     
 - have preliminary program online

### Week T-5

 - Deadline for camera ready version, ACM typically needs it by T-4

 - Deadline for WIP reviews

 - WIP notification (ideally before early registration deadline)
 
 - compose program with time slots

   - notify authors about it (there might be conflicts)

   - advertise on social media, etc.

### Week T-4 to T-2

 - (if applicable) make sure you get the proceedings papers to ACM

 - volunteer PC members to chair session
   (if necessary, often done by organizers)

 - find out what you need in terms of video adapters etc

   - inform speakers

     - need laptop, adapters

     - format of talk (time for talk, time for questions)

### Week T-1

 - there is always something, some last minute things, usually nothing dramatic

 - if you got a Twitter community, use tweetdeck.twitter.com to pre-schedule
   tweets on your program. (think of scheduling them in the right time zone!)

### Week T-0

 - Workshop itself

 - Enjoy, lean back, the speakers do the hard work :)
